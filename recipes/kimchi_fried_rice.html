        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Scramble the eggs.</strong> Heat 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the eggs and scramble them. Transfer the cooked eggs to a bowl and set them aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the vegetables.</strong> Add the remaining vegetable oil, onion, frozen vegetables, garlic, kimchi, and kimchi juice to the skillet and saut√© until the onion is translucent and softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the rice. </strong>Add the rice to the skillet, using a spatula or wooden spoon to break up any clumps. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to stir. Add the scrambled eggs back to the skillet and season with salt and pepper, then serve.</li>
